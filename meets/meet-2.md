## Reading
From [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com):

- [Types and Typeclasses](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses)
- [Syntax in Functions](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions)

## Moderation Plan by Khubaib Naeem Kasbati
- Data types (:t): Int, Integer, Float, Double, Bool, Char
- Type variables like C++ Templates
- TypeClasses: A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior? Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Enum, Bounded, Num, Integral, Floating
- The Holy Grail: Pattern Matching
- Guards. How we wrote functions
    - where

-  Case Expressions

## Problems - 60 minutes

- Add type signatures to all the functions from meet-1. Use your own solutions or the ones in the repository.
- Add appropriate errors messages to the problems from meet-1.
- Rewrite the problems using pattern matching where approriate.
- Problems 1 to 10 from [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)
